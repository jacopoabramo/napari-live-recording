Post-processing support
=======================

When recording a stack of images, it is possible to apply a special post-processing function to the acquired images. After processing, these will be saved as TIFF images on a location which can be chosen by the user.

Post-processing can either consume the stack to produce a single TIFF image or apply modifications to each image of the acquired stack.
